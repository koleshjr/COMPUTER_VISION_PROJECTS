## Digital Africa Plantation Counting Challenge
### Overview

Welcome to the Digital Africa Plantation Counting Challenge! This initiative focuses on creating a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm to address the specific task of counting the number of palm oil trees in an image. Palm oil, derived from the mesocarp of oil palms, is a versatile and widely used product in food manufacturing, beauty products, and biofuel. The success of this challenge holds the potential to aid farmers in determining tree count and estimating crop yield.
### Aim

The primary objective of this challenge is to develop a semi-supervised machine learning algorithm capable of accurately counting the number of palm oil trees in images. This solution aims to empower farmers with a practical tool for plantation management and yield estimation. Additionally, the semi-supervised nature allows for potential applications to other plantations, such as banana palms.
### Importance of the Challenge

    Precision Agriculture: Accurate tree counting facilitates precision farming practices, optimizing resource usage.

    Yield Estimation: Knowing the number of trees aids farmers in estimating crop yield, contributing to effective crop management.

    Applicability to Other Crops: The semi-supervised approach enables the solution to be adapted to various plantations beyond palm oil, such as banana palms.
