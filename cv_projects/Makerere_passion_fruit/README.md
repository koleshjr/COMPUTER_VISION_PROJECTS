## Makerere Passion Fruit Disease Detection Challenge
### Overview

Welcome to the Makerere Passion Fruit Disease Detection Challenge! This competition addresses the critical issue of passion fruit pests and diseases in Uganda, contributing to reduced yields and impacting smallholder farmers, particularly those from low-income households. The lack of reliable and timely diagnostic tools has hindered farmers' ability to combat these challenges effectively.
### Aim

The primary goal of this challenge is to classify the disease status of a passion fruit plant based on images. The solution derived from this challenge has the potential to be deployed as part of a low-cost hand-held diagnostic device, utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. This device aims to empower smallholder farmers with the means to make prompt diagnoses in their passion fruit crops.
### Importance of the Challenge

    Impact on Smallholder Farmers: Most Ugandan farmers, including passion fruit farmers, are smallholders with limited resources. A reliable diagnostic device can significantly benefit them.

    Knowledge Empowerment: Lack of information about crop health is a barrier to timely intervention. A diagnostic device provides farmers with the knowledge to address issues promptly.

    Technology for Agriculture: The Makerere University initiative leverages technology, specifically a Raspberry Pi-based device, to address agricultural challenges.
