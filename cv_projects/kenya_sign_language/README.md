## Kenyan Sign Language Classification
### Overview

Welcome to the Kenyan Sign Language Classification project! This initiative focuses on classifying various Kenyan Sign Languages into different categories. Contrary to a common misconception, sign language is not universal; in fact, there are as many as 300 different languages worldwide, with Kenyan Sign Language (KSL) being a prominent example. KSL is used in Kenya and Somalia, with different dialects depending on the region, serving over half of Kenya's estimated 600,000-strong deaf population.
### Aim

The primary objective of this competition is to develop a model capable of recognizing ten different everyday KSL signs present in images. Leveraging machine learning or deep learning algorithms, participants are tasked with building models that can effectively classify KSL signs, contributing to improved communication and accessibility for the deaf community.
### Importance of KSL

    Diversity in Sign Language: There are numerous sign languages globally, and KSL showcases the rich diversity within this form of communication.

    Regional Variations: KSL exhibits different dialects based on the region, highlighting the adaptability of sign language to local contexts.

    Deaf Community Impact: Developing accurate models for KSL classification enhances communication and understanding within the deaf community.
