## Makerere Fall Armyworm Disease Detection
### Overview

Welcome to the Makerere Fall Armyworm Disease Detection project! This challenge addresses the significant threat posed by the fall armyworm, a devastating pest in Africa causing substantial maize losses for farmers. Smallholder farmers, who heavily rely on maize for food and nutritional security, face challenges due to the lack of natural predators for the fall armyworm.
### Aim

The primary objective of this challenge is to develop a binary image classification model capable of classifying whether a plant has been affected by a fall armyworm. The solution derived from this challenge will be deployed as part of a mobile-based edge application, aiding smallholder farmers in Uganda and across Africa in field-based diagnosis and timely intervention to prevent crop losses.
### Importance of the Challenge

    Food Security: Maize is a staple for over 300 million Africans, and fall armyworm infestation contributes to annual maize losses, impacting food security.

    Economic Impact: Viral pests like fall armyworm are leading causes of food insecurity and poverty in Africa, emphasizing the need for early intervention mechanisms.

    Technology for Smallholder Farmers: Deploying a mobile-based application empowers smallholder farmers with tools for timely and effective crop management.
