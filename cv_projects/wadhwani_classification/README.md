## Wadhwani AI Bollworm Classification Challenge
### Overview

Welcome to the Wadhwani AI Bollworm Classification Challenge! This unique competition aims to enhance a pest control app by improving the classification of images, determining whether they contain a bollworm moth or not. The app, developed by Wadhwani AI, plays a crucial role in assisting farmers by providing AI-generated counts of pests captured in pheromone traps. The challenge focuses on refining the model's ability to accurately identify the absence of pests in images, ensuring user trust and effective pest management.
### Challenge Context

During the kharif season of 2017, cotton farmers in India faced significant crop losses due to bollworm pests. Pheromone traps were introduced to capture male bollworms for reproductive control. The Wadhwani AI app enables farmers to photograph trap catches and receive AI-based recommendations. A key challenge is accurately detecting when no pests are present in the image, avoiding erroneous indications that can erode user trust.
### Aim

The primary objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model capable of classifying images as positive (contains bollworm moths) or negative (no bollworm moths). This model forms an integral part of the Wadhwani AI app, contributing to the accurate assessment of bollworm infestation and guiding informed pest control decisions.
### Importance of the Challenge

    Precision in Pest Control: Accurate classification ensures reliable pest infestation estimates, guiding farmers in effective pesticide application.

    User Trust: Correctly identifying the absence of pests in images is crucial for maintaining user trust in the AI-based recommendations provided by the app.

    Impact on Crop Yield: Effective bollworm pest management positively influences cotton crop yield, benefiting farmers and the agricultural economy.

### Challenge Details

    Objective: Create a machine learning model for binary classification (Positive/Negative) of bollworm moths in images.
    Application: Integration into the Wadhwani AI app for accurate pest count and recommendation generation.
    Challenge Focus: Accurate identification of images with no bollworm moths.
